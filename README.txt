--------------
This R script is used to run the analysis described in Roilo et al. (in review), to compare different land-use intensity (LUI) metrics calculated for the study region Mulde River Basin, Saxony, Germany,
The script is divided into the following sections:
 - grid preparation: describes the preparation of the square, hexagonal, and voronoi grids used in the study;
 - computation of land use variables: describes the calculation of each of the 10 LUI metrics;
 - correlation calculation: describes the calculation of Spearman, Kendall and Pearson correlation coefficient for each pair of LUI metrics;
 - density distributions / ridgeplots: describes the estimation of density distributions for each LUI metric and the plotting of the ridgeplots;
 - mean LUI and SD across metrics: describes the calculation of mean LUI and standard deviation across the 10 metrics for each grid type;
 - Kullback-Leibler distance: describes the calculation of the symmetrical Kullback-Leibler distance for each pair of LUI metrics;
 - make plots of the different grids & metrics: plots all grids and metrics.
